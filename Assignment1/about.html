            <h3>Anita Borg Foundation</h3>
            <img src="images/anita-borg.jpg">
            <p>In 1987, computer scientist Dr. Anita Borg started a digital community for women in computing.
                Over the years, that community has grown and changed to become the leading organization for women in
                technology. Today, AnitaB.org works with women technologists in more than 50 countries, and partners
                with leading academic institutions.</p>
            <p>At AnitaB.org, we envision a future where the people who imagine and build technology mirror the people
                and societies for whom they build it. We connect, inspire, and guide women in computing, and
                organizations that view technology innovation as a strategic imperative.</p>
            <p>AnitaB.org continues to extend our global outreach to women considering and currently pursuing technical
                careers in computing through in-person and online programs such as our Abie Awards, AnitaB.org local
                communities, and a variety of social networks. True to our history, we’re here to break down boundaries,
                advocate for change, and remain persistent in the face of adversity.</p>

            <h3>Grace Hopper</h3>
            <img src="images/grace-hopper.jpg">
            <p> Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. After the war,
                Hopper remained with the Navy as a reserve officer. As a research fellow at Harvard, she worked with
                the Mark II and Mark III computers. She was at Harvard when a moth was found to have shorted out the
                Mark II, and is sometimes given credit for the invention of the term "computer bug"—though she
                didn't actually author the term, she did help popularize it.</p>
            <p> Wanting to continue to work with computers, Hopper moved into private industry in 1949, first with the
                Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, then with Remington Rand, where she oversaw programming for the
                UNIVAC computer.</p>
            <p>In 1952, her team created the first compiler for computer languages (a compiler renders worded
                instructions into code that can be read by computers). This compiler was a precursor for the Common
                Business Oriented Language, or COBOL, a widely adapted language that would be used around the world.
                Though she did not invent COBOL, Hopper encouraged its adaptation.</p>

            <h3>Celebration</h3>
            <img src="images/celebration.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
            <p>Every year, women technologists and the best minds in computing convene to highlight the contributions of
                women to computing. AnitaB.org co-presents GHC with the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
            <p>The celebration results in collaborative proposals, networking and mentoring for our attendees. GHC
                presenters are leaders in their respective fields, representing industry, academia and government. The
                celebration also offers professional development through a variety of activities. </p>
            <p>Grace Hopper Celebration 18 was the largest celebration yet, an unforgettable experience filled with
                amazing opportunities, and exceptional content focused around technology. Women came to network, learn,
                and find community. Organizations came to learn how to build inclusive cultures and find technical
                talent. GHC 18, held in Houston, TX hosted 20,000 attendees from 81 countries. It offered over 400
                sessions with more than 800 speakers.</p>
