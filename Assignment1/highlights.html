                Snappy Hour took place at the Grove Restaurant and was one of the best evening parties of GHC! They had
                a mac-and-cheese bar, a line-up of chefs serving fresh food, a huge cheese table, lawn games, a spin-the-wheel game, a station
                for filling surprise bags for charity, a huge table of cheese, and awesome prizes! I spun to win a huge
                stuffy of the dancing hotdog!

                all customer and strategic relations. She joined SpaceX in 2002 as Vice President of Business Development,

                The general public can visit Johnson Space Center only via Space Center Houston's open-air tram tour.
                The tour includes Building 30 (location of the Historic Mission Operations Control Room 2 and Rocket
                Park with a restored Saturn V rocket.
                Visiting Mission Control and learning about the first missions to space was a lot of fun, and seeing the
                Saturn V in person was mesmerizing! I had no idea how much fuel it took to get people into space, and how
                huge the rockets were!
