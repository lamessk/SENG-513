                Hello, my name is Lamess Kharfan! Back in September 2018 I had the amazing opportunity to travel to
                Houston, Texas with six other amazing women from the University of Calgary to attend the world's largest
                gathering of women in technology in the world, the Grace Hopper Celebration! While there I attended
                workshops, keynote speeches, talks, and the amazing career fair. I also got to meet many female
                technologists, overcame my imposter syndrome, and got to understand my place in technology as a female!
